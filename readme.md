# Invoce Generator 

## Problem Statement
Recently, I completed a client's project and they asked me to send them an invoice with the price quote, I rushed online to look for an invoice generator solution.Most of the solutions I found, needed me to signup and pay for a subscription.
Being a developer, the idea of paying for something that I have the skills to make did not sit well with me, so I decided to take on the challengeand  create my own Invoice generator.
